;;; Commentary:

;; Snakemake mode provides support for editing Snakemake [1] files. It
;; builds on Python mode to provide fontification, indentation, and
;; imenu indexing for Snakemake's rule blocks.
;;
;; If Snakemake mode is installed from MELPA, no additional setup is
;; required. It will be loaded the first time a file named 'Snakefile'
;; is opened.
;;
;; Otherwise, put snakemake-mode.el in your `load-path' and add
;;
;;     (require 'snakemake-mode)
;;
;; to your initialization file.
